\title{Suggest Hyperparameters for tuning HMDA Grids}
\usage{
hmda.suggest.param(algorithm, n_models, x = NULL, family = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{algorithm}{A character string specifying the algorithm, which
can be either "gbm" (gradient boosting machines) or "drf"
(distributed random forest).}

\item{n_models}{An integer for the desired approximate number of
model combinations in the grid. Must be at least 100.}

\item{x}{(Optional) A vector of predictor names.
If provided and its length is at least 20, it is used
to compute mtries for DRF.Ã¥}

\item{family}{(Optional) A character string indicating the
modeling family. Must be either "classification"
or "regression". This is used with \code{x} to
suggest mtries.}
}
\value{
A named list of hyperparameter value vectors. This list is
        suitable for use with HMDA and H2O grid search functions.
}
\description{
Suggests candidate hyperparameter values for tree-based
  algorithms. It computes a hyperparameter grid whose total number
  of model combinations is near a specified target. For GBM models,
  default candidates include max_depth, ntrees, learn_rate,
  sample_rate, and col_sample_rate. For DRF models, if a vector of predictor
  variables (\code{x}) and a modeling family ("regression" or "classificaiton")
  are provided, a vector of mtries is also suggested.
}
\details{
The function first checks that \code{n_models} is at least 100,
  then validates the \code{family} parameter if provided. The
  algorithm name is normalized to lowercase and must be either
  "gbm" or "drf". For "gbm", a default grid of hyperparameters is
  defined. For "drf", if both \code{x} and \code{family} are provided,
  the function computes mtries via \code{suggest_mtries()}. If not,
  a default grid is set without mtries. Finally, the candidate grid is
  pruned or expanded using \code{hmda.adjust.params()} so that the
  total number of combinations is near \code{n_models}.

  library(h2o)
  h2o.init()

  # Example 1: Suggest hyperparameters for GBM with about 120 models.
  params_gbm <- hmda.suggest.param("gbm", n_models = 120)
  print(params_gbm)

  # Example 2: Suggest hyperparameters for DRF (classification) with
  # 100 predictors.
  params_drf <- hmda.suggest.param(
                  algorithm = "drf",
                  n_models = 150,
                  x = paste0("V", 1:100),
                  family = "classification"
                )
  print(params_drf)
