\title{Suggest Alternative Values for mtries in Random Forest}
\usage{
suggest_mtries(p, family = c("classification", "regression"))
}
\arguments{
\item{p}{Integer. The number of features (predictors) in the dataset.}

\item{family}{Character string. Either \code{"classification"} or \code{"regression"}.}
}
\value{
An integer vector of suggested values for \code{mtries}.
}
\description{
Provides a set of suggested values for the \code{mtries} parameter based on the
number of features (\code{p}) and the modeling family. These values serve as
alternatives to the common defaults: \code{sqrt(p)} for classification and
\code{p/3} for regression.
}
\details{
\strong{Default Behavior in Random Forest}:
\itemize{
  \item \code{mtries = -1} in H2O means "use all features."
  \item Traditional implementations in other frameworks often use
        \code{sqrt(p)} for classification and \code{p/3} for regression.
}

\strong{Suggested Alternatives}:
\itemize{
  \item For classification, people often try \code{log2(p)}, or smaller exponents
        of \code{p} (e.g., \code{p^(1/3)}), in addition to \code{sqrt(p)}.
  \item For regression, people sometimes try smaller fractions of \code{p},
        such as \code{p/5} or \code{p/2}, instead of \code{p/3}.
}
The best choice can depend on the problem size, data structure, and correlation between predictors.
