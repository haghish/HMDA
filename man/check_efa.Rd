\usage{
check_efa(
  df,
  features,
  min_unique = 5,
  min_intercorrelation = 0.3,
  verbatim = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A dataframe containing the features.}

\item{features}{A character vector of feature names to be evaluated.}

\item{min_unique}{An integer specifying the minimum number of unique non-missing
values required for a feature. Default is 5.}

\item{min_intercorrelation}{A numeric threshold for the minimum acceptable
intercorrelation among features. (Note: this parameter is not used explicitly in the current implementation.) Default is 0.3.}

\item{verbatim}{Logical; if \code{TRUE}, a confirmation message is printed when all
features appear suitable. Default is \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
\code{TRUE} if all features are deemed suitable for EFA, and \code{FALSE}
  otherwise. In the latter case, messages detailing the issues are printed.
}
\description{
Checks if specified features in a dataframe meet criteria for performing exploratory factor analysis (EFA).
This function verifies that each feature exists, is numeric, has sufficient variability,
and does not have an excessive proportion of missing values. For multiple features, it also
assesses the full rank of the correlation matrix and the level of intercorrelation among features.
}
\details{
The function performs several checks:
\describe{
  \item{Existence}{Verifies that each feature in \code{features} is present in \code{df}.}
  \item{Numeric Type}{Checks that each feature is numeric.}
  \item{Variability}{Ensures that each feature has at least \code{min_unique} unique non-missing values.}
  \item{Missing Values}{Flags features with more than 20\% missing values.}
}

If more than one feature is provided, the function computes the correlation matrix
(using pairwise complete observations) and checks:
\describe{
  \item{Full Rank}{Whether the correlation matrix is full rank. A rank lower than the
    number of features indicates redundancy.}
  \item{Intercorrelations}{Identifies features that do not have any correlation (>= 0.4)
    with the other features.}
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
  # Example: assess feature suitability for EFA using the USJudgeRatings dataset.
  # this dataset contains ratings on several aspects of U.S. federal judges' performance.
  # Here, we check whether these rating variables are suitable for EFA.
  data("USJudgeRatings")
  features_to_check <- colnames(USJudgeRatings[,-1])
  result <- check_efa(
    df = USJudgeRatings,
    features = features_to_check,
    min_unique = 3,
    verbatim = TRUE
  )

  # TRUE indicates the features are suitable.
  print(result)
}
