Description: This R package introduces Holistic Multimodel Domain Analysis (HMDA),
    an new paradigm for exploring domains related to an outcome. HMDA trains a 
    grid of supervised learning models, and instead of selecting the best-performing 
    model, it takes the inconsistencies between the good models into account to 
    explore domains of items and indicators related to an outcome. For each of the
    models, Weighted Mean SHAP (WMSHAP) is computed, taking the performance of the 
    model into account.
